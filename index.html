  <p class="firstpar">My name is Rachel Bautista, I have been currently living in Irvine, California since 2012. Before going to UC Irvine I was residing in Riverside, CA so believe me I know about hot summers. I am the 2nd oldest child of 4 and none of my siblings look alike. Yes we are all from the same parents, the milk-man was not involved (so I think). </p>
  <p>I love to learn new things especially when it makes my life easier. I would love to travel to Japan one day but for now I am trying to learn Japanese on my own. I also would like to learn French and Korean. I mean it will only take me like 30 years but meh. </p>
  <p>It was not until this past summer that I started to get interested in web development. There are many things that I like about this course so far. I love that we get enough exposure to everything and that allows us to choose whatever subject we would like to dive deeper in. So far I enjoy front-end a lot, but I am very curious to learn back-end. </p>
